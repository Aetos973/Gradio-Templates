# 🚀 Gradio AI Template – MVP

**A Modular, Theme-Switchable, Low-Latency Gradio Template for Generative AI Apps**

This project is a **production-ready Gradio starter** tailored for building and scaling **AI apps**, starting with **text-to-image generation**.

Built to support:
- 🧠 Multiple local and Hugging Face models  
- 🛠️ Real-time prompt transformation with LLMs  
- 🎨 Dynamic theme switching (dark, light, pastel, cyberpunk, etc.)  
- 📈 Image generation tracking and session-based status logging  

Use this as your **jumpstart framework** for building AI UX like Midjourney, Leonardo, or Ideogram – without rewriting boilerplate.

Most Gradio projects are either:
- too **basic** (no modularity, no scale)
- or too **bloated** (monolithic, hard to customize)

**Problems this project solves:**
- ⚠️ No more hardcoded configs  
- 💀 Say goodbye to rigid, static UI themes  
- 🐌 Faster model inference with caching & fallback  
- 🤖 Better prompt control with LLM pre-processing  
- 📉 Live user feedback and task progress tracking

This template is built to:
- Scale with multiple models  
- Enhance user experience  
- Speed up development cycles  
- Provide a clean starting point for future AI pipelines

---

**Core Stack:**
- 🐍 Python + Gradio  
- 🧩 Modular folder structure: `config/`, `model/`, `utils/`, `template/`, `app.py`  
- 🤗 Hugging Face + Joblib loader with validation  
- 🎨 Themed UI: Classic, Minimal, Pastel, Glass, Cyberpunk, Modern  
- 💬 Prompt optimizer using Mistral (via Hugging Face Transformers)  
- 🪵 Logging + Progress Tracker for real-time UX feedback  
- 🔐 Secure config management via `settings.py`

**Quickstart:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gradio-ai-template.git
cd gradio-ai-template

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the app
python app.py
```

**This project is for:**
- Developers building fast MVPs with AI/LLM workflows (esp. Text-to-Image).
- ML engineers who want a clean and modular Gradio base with multi-model support.
- Creators who want to focus on *what* they want to generate, not *how* to engineer the perfect prompt.
- Devs who need easy theming, real-time model switching, and progress feedback out of the box.

**This is *not* for:**
- People who want an out-of-the-box SaaS product with no coding involved.
- Beginners unfamiliar with Python or how to set up a virtual environment.

## 🚀 The Outcome

This starter kit gives you:
- ✅ A low-latency, themeable Gradio interface.
- ✅ Hugging Face + traditional ML model support (via `.pkl` and Transformers).
- ✅ Prompt transformation logic powered by Mistral to make your prompts *fire*.
- ✅ Modular architecture ready for scaling, agent integration, or full-stack AI workflows.
- ✅ Real-time tracker for user actions and feedback — no more guessing what’s happening.
- ✅ Easy extension: plug in new themes, models, or UI features without breaking the core.

**Use this to ship projects faster**, demo AI tools quicker, or just streamline your own workflow without building from scratch.
