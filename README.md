# 🚀 Gradio AI Template – MVP

**A Modular, Theme-Switchable, Low-Latency Gradio Template for Generative AI Apps**

This project is a **production-ready Gradio starter** tailored for building and scaling **AI apps**, starting with **text-to-image generation**.

Built to support:
- 🧠 Multiple local and Hugging Face models  
- 🛠️ Real-time prompt transformation with LLMs  
- 🎨 Dynamic theme switching (dark, light, pastel, cyberpunk, etc.)  
- 📈 Image generation tracking and session-based status logging  

Use this as your **jumpstart framework** for building AI UX like Midjourney, Leonardo, or Ideogram – without rewriting boilerplate.

Most Gradio projects are either:
- too **basic** (no modularity, no scale)
- or too **bloated** (monolithic, hard to customize)

**Problems this project solves:**
- ⚠️ No more hardcoded configs  
- 💀 Say goodbye to rigid, static UI themes  
- 🐌 Faster model inference with caching & fallback  
- 🤖 Better prompt control with LLM pre-processing  
- 📉 Live user feedback and task progress tracking

This template is built to:
- Scale with multiple models  
- Enhance user experience  
- Speed up development cycles  
- Provide a clean starting point for future AI pipelines
